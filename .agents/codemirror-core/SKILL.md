# CodeMirror Core Integration

This document outlines the core integration patterns for CodeMirror 6 inside Grayslate. For specific editor extensions (like hover tooltips or autocomplete), see `.agents/editor-extensions/SKILL.md`.

## Integration Guidelines

- **Use `@codemirror/state` and `@codemirror/view` correctly.**
- **Conceptual Separation:** Keep the CodeMirror `EditorState` conceptually separated from Svelte's `$state` unless explicitly synchronizing document content. Avoid deep reactivity loops between the two.
- **Clean Transactions:** Dispatch `Transaction` objects cleanly for editor updates rather than violently replacing the document text.
- **Performance First:** When building extensions (Fold widgets, Tooltips, Inlay Hints), **never** write unbounded `while` loops that traverse the Lezer tree (e.g. counting every child of a JSON Array). Cap iterations aggressively (e.g. `MAX_SCAN_CHILDREN = 100`) to prevent the main thread from freezing when users paste gigabyte-sized files.
- **Experimental Extensions:** Unused or WIP CodeMirror extensions (like `stickyScroll`) are kept in `src/lib/editor/extensions/experimental/`. Do not delete these files, but do not import them into the main `languageExtensions.ts` config unless specifically requested.
